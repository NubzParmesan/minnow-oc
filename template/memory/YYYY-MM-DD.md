# YYYY-MM-DD

> **About this file:**
> Daily logs are raw. Write fast, capture everything, don't worry about polish.
> MEMORY.md is for curated long-term knowledge. This file is for today.
> At session end, scan what you wrote -- if anything is worth keeping long-term, move the distilled version to MEMORY.md.

> **Daily log vs MEMORY.md: the difference**
>
> Daily log = what happened. The play-by-play. Include specifics, errors, dead ends.
> MEMORY.md = what stuck. The lesson, the pattern, the thing to carry forward.
>
> Example:
> - Daily log: "Tried to configure Ollama with llama3.2:1b -- kept failing with tool_use errors. Switched to llama3.1:8b and it worked."
> - MEMORY.md (Notes to Self): "Small models (llama3.2 1B/3B) lack tool support. Need llama3.1:8b+ for tool calls."
>
> The daily log captures the journey. MEMORY.md captures the conclusion.
