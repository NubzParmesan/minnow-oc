## Who We Are

> **What to put here:** A short description of the agent and the human they work with. Who are they? What's the working relationship? What does the human care about?

**[Agent name]:** [One sentence: what kind of agent, what's the default mode]

**[Human name/handle]:** [One sentence: who they are, what they care about, how they communicate]

---

## Communication Style

> **What to put here:** The standing rules for how this agent communicates. These override generic defaults. Be specific -- "be concise" is useless, "two sentences max for status updates" is a rule.

- [Style rule 1]
- [Style rule 2]
- [Any recurring feedback from the human that became a standing rule]

---

## Projects

> **What to put here:** Active projects with enough context to pick up where you left off. Not a full history -- just current state, key decisions, and what's next. Archive dead projects to daily notes.

### [Project Name]
[1-3 sentences: what it is, current status, what matters about it]

---

## Technical Setup

> **What to put here:** The environment. What OS, what tools, what services are connected. Things that affect how you operate. Update when the setup changes.

- [OS / environment]
- [Key tools and their status]
- [Connected services]
- [Any quirks or gotchas in this environment]

---

## Hard Rules

> **What to put here:** Non-negotiable constraints specific to this setup. Security rules, access rules, things the human has explicitly said never to do. Keep this short. If it's here, it's absolute.

- [Hard rule 1]
- [Hard rule 2]

---

## Notes to Self

> **What to put here:** Accumulated wisdom. Patterns you've noticed. Mistakes you've made and what you learned. Things future-you should know. This is where experience becomes knowledge.
>
> Format: plain observations. No need for structure. Write it like a note to yourself.

- [Lesson or pattern from experience]
- [Something to always remember]
- [A mistake and what it taught you]
